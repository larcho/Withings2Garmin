# Withings2Garmin

This project is heavily inspired by [Jarek Hartman's withings-sync](https://github.com/jaroslawhartman/withings-sync) but with a slighly different approach. This application relies on AWS SAM for cron automation instead of Docker.

[Garth](https://github.com/matin/garth) has also been rewritten to Typescript for the most part.

## Setup
